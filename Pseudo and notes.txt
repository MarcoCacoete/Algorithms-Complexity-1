First algo seems to work but for too long? Havent followed to the end yet.

Second algo idea, pusher.

If array index +1 > array index +2

array index +1 = array index +2 and array index +2 = array index +1

++index

if my logic is correct, it should push values over lower values.

Another idea, find out how many digits the highest int has
do a pass segregating numbers by digit number then sort those sections

idea for search, predictive search, check initial number, compare to highest value in array and lowest do subtraction and addition
whichever is lower dictates direction, divite lower half or higher half in zones, keep doing same logic as above, finding different 
values for operations until resul matches.

Idea for counting and displaying indexes for all indexes with same value.

while array[index+1] == array [index]
	print " array [index] also found at array [index+x etc]"
same deal for elements before index but with index -1

TODO
Implement error handling for every input.
