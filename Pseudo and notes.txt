First algo seems to work but for too long? Havent followed to the end yet.

Second algo idea, pusher.

If array index +1 > array index +2

array index +1 = array index +2 and array index +2 = array index +1

++index

if my logic is correct, it should push values over lower values.

Another idea, find out how many digits the highest int has
do a pass segregating numbers by digit number then sort those sections
